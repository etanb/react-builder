This is a list of things to do
Some may be too low priority, but at least this list has a good coverage

BIG THINGS =========================
- Editing nested components (tab sets, the Section component, etc)
The property editors have access to the page model, but the page model
doesn't really have a good way to add/remove/reorder child regions

SMALL THINGS =======================
- Mock out property editors for components that need them
Some components have empty property editors (they just say
"This component has no properties."

- Figure out a way to easily style the regions so that they are
responsive to different sizes. It would be nice to make it so that
it's easy to switch between different "templates"

- Make "Shrink to view" work in a dumb way.
Instead of actually zooming the canvas area, just set a max width

- The SDS CSS causes the font size to grow when the window is made
smaller than a certain size. We probably don't want it, but it's not
a HUGE deal if it's not fixed

- Dropdowns should close when you click away from them

- Should the palette say "Custom components aren't enabled", or
"You don't have any custom components"
- Save button should say "Changes saved" to simulate saving
- We should have a drop shadow around the canvas are to look more like
the production app builder
- The input box to "search componets" in the component palette should
have a magnifying glass on it. It probably doesn't need to function, though :)
- Should the component palette sections be collapsible?
- When switching tabs in a tab set by dragging over a tab, a green
border appears around the tab. In production it has a little green flashing
animation

- For real synchronicity with the production app builder, the property
editor should only update properties on "blur", instead of on any change

- Fix the Section component so it doesn't expand past the region's width
